Description</FONT></H1>
<P>This document presents an overview of the hardware design of the Handy 
Cricket.</P>
<P>The Handy Cricket's primary components are the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>PICmicro&reg; microprocessor.</B> The Handy Cricket is based on the 
  PIC16C715, which includes 2048 bytes of one-time programmable ROM (burned with 
  the Handy Cricket operating system), analog inputs, and digital I/O. The PIC 
  is the “brain” of the Handy Cricket. 
  <LI><B>Serial EEPROM memory for user programs.</B> Compiled user code is 
  loaded into a 24LC32 memory chip, which provides 4096 bytes of non-volatile 
  storage. 
  <LI><B>IrDA communications chip.</B> Using the Sharp GP2W0001YP chip, the 
  Handy Cricket implements bi-directional infrared communications for program 
  download and inter-Cricket communications. This chip is an IrDA component, but 
  the Handy Cricket uses its own modulation scheme, so the Cricket isn't 
  compatible with conventional IrDA devices. 
  <LI><B>Dual motor driver chip.</B> The Texas Instruments SN754410NE dual 
  H-bridge motor driver allows the Handy Cricket to directly power two DC 
  motors. 
  <LI><B>Assorted I/O components.</B> The Handy Cricket includes two analog 
  sensor ports, two bus expansion boards, a piezo beeper, a run status LED, and 
  a run/stop pushbutton. </LI></UL>
<P>Let's look at the Handy Cricket circuit design in detail. Here is the 
schematic diagram: 
<P align=center><IMG

<H2><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Circuits in Detail</FONT></H2>
<P>We will discuss the circuit based from the PICmicro&reg; PIC16C715, progressing 
clockwise from pin 1 of the microprocessor.</P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Serial EEPROM</FONT></H3>
<P>Pins 1 and 2 of the PIC16C715 are connected to the clock and data pins of the 
24LC32A, the 4096-byte serial EEPROM memory. The PIC communicates with the 
24LC32A using the Philips i2c protocol, an industry standard inter-IC 
communications method.</P>
<P>The 24LC32A holds the compiled Logo program that is executed by the Handy 
Cricket. Also, non-volatile data can be written to the memory by the user code. 
Array data and recorded sensor data is stored in the memory along with the 
executable Logo code.</P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Run/Stop Button and Run Status 
LED</FONT></H3>
<P>Pin 3 of the PIC is multiplexed to control the Run Status LED and read the 
Run/Stop pushbutton.</P>
<P>The pin is driven low to turn on the Run Status LED (indicating that the 
Handy Cricket is executing a Logo program). To check if the Run/Stop pushbutton 
is pressed, the line is allowed to float; if it is read as low, then the button 
is pressed.</P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">PIC Reset Pin</FONT></H3>
<P>Pin 4 of the PIC is the microprocessor reset pin. It is permanently wired 
high, allowing the processor to run normally at all times.</P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">PIC Ground Pin</FONT></H3>
<P>Pin 5, Vss, is the microprocessor ground.</P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">IrDA Circuit</FONT></H3>
<P>The Handy Cricket uses a Sharp GP2W00001YP IrDA transceiver for 
communications. This is an IrDA component rated for communications up to 115 
kbaud, but the Cricket uses its own byte-oriented modulation scheme which 
provides an effective data rate of about 50 kbaud.</P>
<P>There are several resistors and capacitors associated with the IrDA circuit, 
implemented as per the data sheet recommendations. C1 and R4 provide the IrDA 
part with a degree of isolation from fluctuations in the main logic power 
supply.</P>
<P>Pin 6/Port B0 of the PIC accepts the digital IR receive signal from the Sharp 
component. This pin is the external interrupt pin, and the Cricket's software 
uses an interrupt routine to implement the receive data processing.</P>
<P>Pin 7/Port B1 is the digital transmit signal. R2 and C4 provide the 
recommended method of interfacing this signal to the IrDA component. R3 limits 
current through the transmit LED. Finally, R5 and LED5 provide a visual 
indicator of transmit activity.
<P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Bus Expansion Ports</FONT></H3>
<P>Pin 8/Port B2 is the bi-directional Cricket bus signal. The Cricket bus is a 
custom “one-wire” protocol that allows a master Cricket to communicate with a 
collection of connected slave devices. For more details on the Cricket bus, see 
<A 
href="http://handyboard.com/cricket/tech/bus.shtml">http://handyboard.com/cricket/tech/bus.shtml</A>. 

<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Piezo Beeper</FONT></H3>
<P>Pin 9/Port B3 is the piezo output signal. The Cricket gives a “boot beep” 
every time it's powered up; tones of varying pitch and duration may also be 
generated under user program control.</P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Motor Control Circuit</FONT></H3>
<P>Pins 10 through 13/Port B4–7 are the motor control pins. The motor control 
circuit is based on the Texas Instruments SN754410NE dual motor driver. </P>
<P>The SN754410NE provides two “H-bridge” motor control circuits. Each H-bridge 
has three inputs: left-side input, right-side input, and enable. When the left- 
and right-side input pins are opposite values (10 or 01), and the enable is 
high, then current flows through a motor connected to the drive pins.</P>
<P>PIC pins 11 and 12 control the Cricket's motor A output; pins 10 and 13 
control the motor B output. The enable signal for motor A is generated by OR'ing 
the two motor A control signals together, using one of the OR gates provided by 
U5. This circuit allows the Cricket to provide four operating modes to the 
motor:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>If the two control pins are 0, the enable will be off, and the motor 
  outputs are idle. 
  <LI>If one output pin is high and the other is low, the enable will be on, and 
  the H-bridge will drive the motor one way or the other. 
  <LI>If both output pins are high, then the enable will be on, but both halves 
  of the H-bridge outputs will be driven to the same voltage, and the motor will 
  be actively braked. </LI></UL>
<P>The SN754410NE chip has two power inputs: a logic supply (pin 16, Vcc1) and 
the motor power supply (pin 8, Vcc2). The motor power supply is connected 
directly to the battery, after the Cricket's main power switch. </P>
<P>But the chip's logic supply is switched by a pair of OR gates! If both motors 
are turned off, then then is no need to provide logic voltage to the motor chip. 
The chip uses about 20 mA of current when it's sitting idle (motors off), so 
removing the logic voltage provides a substantial current savings.</P>
<P>Two of the four OR gates in the U5 package are used to switch logic power to 
the motor chip itself. The two enable signals are OR'ed together to produce the 
logic supply voltage. If either or both of the motors are enabled, the supply 
voltage is provided. Gates U5a and U5b perform this OR function and are wired in 
parallel, doubling the current available to the SN754410NE chip from the OR 
gates.</P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">PIC Power Pin</FONT></H3>
<P>Pin 14 is the PIC's power pin. The normal logic supply voltages is applied to 
this pin.</P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">PIC Oscillator Pins</FONT></H3>
<P>Pins 15 and 16 are the PIC oscillator pins. The Cricket uses a 4 MHz 
oscillator, and the Cricket's firmware is based on the resulting 1 microsecond 
instruction clock.</P>
<H3><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Analog Sensor Inputs</FONT></H3>
<P>Pins 17 and 18/Port A0 and 1 are used as the Cricket's two analog sensor 
inputs. The PIC provides an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter, allowing the 
Cricket to convert sensor voltages to a numeric range of 0 to 255.</P>
