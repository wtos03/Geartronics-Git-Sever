<P align=3Djustify>However his life was soon to be shattered. The French =

kept out of trouble until late in 1791 when he accepted the position of =

of the Peace in Lyon. This post made it virtually impossible for him to =

<P align=3Djustify>The effect on Amp=E8re of his father's death was =

<P align=3Djustify>Despite this coolness they were engaged to be married =
